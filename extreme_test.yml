# 11. EDGE CASES THAT COMMONLY FAIL
# ============================================================================
edge_cases:

  version: "Requires Minecraft v1.19.4 or higher"
  permission_node: "player.admin.teleport.others"

  possessive_heavy: "The player's team's leader's decision was final."

  # Mixed structure
  json_in_message: "Config: {\"enabled\":true,\"value\":100}"

  # Length test (should not exceed limits)
